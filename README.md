- A Gemini API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### 1. Add Your API Key

Create a file named `.env` in the root of this project and add your Gemini API key to it:

```
VITE_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_goes_here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal in the project root and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
